# Noter-frontend

This repository contains the source codes for noter-frontend, which is a free
to use online tool with the following two major functionalities:
1. Annotate histroical images of buildings with the constituent components (e.g.
facade, windows, entries, stairs, etc)

2. If the building footprint is available, associate the annotated building
facades with the building footprint: one annotated building facade can only be
associated to one side of the footprint polygon, which are correponding to each
other physically.

This repository is built on top of [makesense.ai][1], which is a free to use
online tool for labelling photos.
